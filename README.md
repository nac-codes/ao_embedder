Available at: https://vw6ngollaul3yg3dxysjr27kma6nlfwmquyy2bgtprkhpu2qkngq.arweave.net/rbzTOWsFF7wbY74kmOvqYDzVlsyFMY0E03xUd9NQU00/

## Overview

The AO Embedder Prototype is a web-based application designed to demonstrate the embedding process for a predefined set of words on the permaweb, using Arweave technology through ArConnect integration. This prototype aims to showcase the potential of creating an embedder on AO that can handle extensive data sets with multiple concurrent processes. Currently, it operates with a limited set of words, serving as a foundational step towards achieving scalable data handling capabilities.

## Features

- **Easy Web Access**: No installation required â€” access directly through your web browser.
- **Secure ArConnect Integration**: Connect to the Arweave network securely to send and receive data.
- **Predefined Word Set Embedding**: Embed words from a predefined limited set directly onto the permaweb.
- **Dynamic Results**: View the embedding output directly within the web interface after processing.
- **Material UI Design**: Enjoy a clean and responsive user interface for an optimal user experience.

## Prerequisites

- An internet connection to access the website.
- An [ArConnect](https://arconnect.io/) wallet setup for interacting with the Arweave network.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Upon accessing the website, use the "Connect to ArConnect" button to link your ArConnect wallet securely.
2. **Embed Words**: Enter your desired words from the available list into the text input field. The current version supports a limited set of words as part of its prototype nature.
3. **Initiate Embedding Process**: Click on "Send Message" after entering your words to start the embedding process.
4. **Review Output**: After the process completes, the embedding output will be displayed under "Embedding Output".

## Limitations

The current prototype supports only a limited selection of words for embedding. We are actively working on expanding its capabilities to support larger datasets and to facilitate multiple concurrent embedding processes.
