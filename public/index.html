      content="the application facilitates seamless embedding of selected words into the permaweb using Arweave technology. It's designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that users can easily connect their ArConnect wallets, choose words from a predefined list, and execute the embedding process with just a few clicks. This prototype aims to showcase the potential of permanent, decentralized data storage and accessibility, highlighting innovation in how data is managed and preserved on the blockchain. As development progresses, the goal is to expand its capabilities to support larger data sets and facilitate multiple concurrent processes, moving towards a more scalable solution for data embedding on the permaweb.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
